# Observability Agent

The **observability** agent helps add logging, tracing, metrics, and SLOs to TypeScript/JavaScript applications.

## What It Sets Up

Currently a **placeholder**—the agent provides high-level guidance. Full instructions will be expanded in a future release.

## Goals (Scope)

- **Logging and tracing** — Structured logging, distributed tracing (OpenTelemetry)
- **Metrics and dashboards** — Latency, errors, throughput, basic dashboards/alerting
- **Error handling and SLOs** — Consistent error reporting, error budgets, SLO definitions

## What It Provides

- Conceptual guidance for instrumentation
- Integration patterns for common backends (Datadog, Grafana, CloudWatch)
- Open standards (OTel, Prometheus) orientation

## Prompts to Improve Your App

Use these prompts once the agent is fully expanded, or to get general guidance:

- **"Add OpenTelemetry tracing to our Express API"** — Distributed tracing
- **"Set up Prometheus metrics for request latency and error rate"** — Metrics
- **"Create a basic SLO for our API availability"** — SLO definition
- **"Recommend a logging and metrics setup for our serverless functions"** — Serverless
- **"How do we integrate with Grafana for dashboards?"** — Dashboards
